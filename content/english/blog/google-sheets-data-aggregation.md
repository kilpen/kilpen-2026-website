## Business Problem

The client faced efficiency challenges stemming from significant waste related to employees manually updating Google Sheets that fed business critical decision making information. Operating with over 150 concurrent projects, each requiring its own spreadsheet, leadership lacked an automated method to consolidate data across this distributed portfolio.

## Mission

Create a tool to dynamically identify key data elements across 150+ Google Sheets. The solution needed sufficient sophistication to extract 100+ data points per sheet despite varying formats, while also facilitating future Salesforce migration.

## Solution

The team developed a containerized Google Sheets application that:

- Systematically reviewed indexed sheets
- Extracted critical information from each sheet
- Established a robust data model with integrity checks
- Identified missing data automatically
- Enabled custom reporting for executives

This structured approach empowered executives with consolidated insights despite their geographically distributed data sources.

## Timeline

**Completion:** One month
