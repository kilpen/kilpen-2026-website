## Business Problem

The client faced constraints in a low-margin sector without budget for commercial fleet tracking software. As operations expanded, monitoring vehicle maintenance and licensing renewals became increasingly challenging. They needed:

- A centralized system to gather service and mileage data from technicians and drivers
- Automated email notifications for timely service completion
- License renewal reminders

## Mission

Leverage Google Sheets, Forms, and Gmail to enhance an existing Fleet Manager spreadsheet and form system. Upgrade the underlying code to eliminate bugs while implementing new reminder functionality for management oversight.

## Solution

Rather than patching existing code, the team chose complete reconstruction:

- Established a data model enabling object-oriented programming
- Designed for future scalability and product evolution
- Retained the client's familiar Fleet Manager interface
- Delivered reliable backend code updates
- Implemented dependable service reminders

## Timeline

**Completion:** One month
