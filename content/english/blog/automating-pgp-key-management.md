SKILL LEVEL:  Advanced.

In this article, we will be implementing one approach to centralize PGP key issuing and distribution for an organization.  We'll use an existing Linux instance's GnuPG tool to issue and manage keys.  To distribute keys to users, we'll use the 1Password CLI.   Let's dive in!

# The Infrastructure #
We're using a stripped down Debian 12 "Bookworm" instance running at a cloud service provider.  The instance is isolated from external network traffic and requires Cloudflare WARP to connect.  SSH is enabled on the Virtual Private Server (VPS) and requires certificate authentication along with password and a Two-Factor OTP.

## Packages needed ##
Depending on your VPS, some of these may be needed while others may already be installed.
* openssh-server - SSH access
* libpam-google-authenticator - 2FA OTP
* nano - Text editor
* sudo - To execute commands with elevated priviledges
* gnupg - To manage PGP keys
* curl - To download files (needed for 1Password Setup)
* 1password-cli - Linux version of 1Passwords Command Line Interface (CLI)
* jq - To parse JSON

## Install needed packages ##
Let's get started by installing the needed packages except for the 1Password-CLI.  You'll need to be logged in as root OR have sudo installed already.
```bash
sudo apt install -y openssh-server libpam-google-authenticator nano gnupg curl
```

**Now, let's install the 1Password-CLI.**
*Source: https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started*

Add the key for the 1Password apt repository:
```bash
curl -sS https://downloads.1password.com/linux/keys/1password.asc | \
 sudo gpg --dearmor --output /usr/share/keyrings/1password-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Add the 1Password apt repository:
```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/1password-archive-keyring.gpg] https://downloads.1password.com/linux/debian/$(dpkg --print-architecture) stable main" |
 sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/1password.list
```

Add the debsig-verify policy:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/debsig/policies/AC2D62742012EA22/
```

```bash
curl -sS https://downloads.1password.com/linux/debian/debsig/1password.pol | \
 sudo tee /etc/debsig/policies/AC2D62742012EA22/1password.pol
```

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/debsig/keyrings/AC2D62742012EA22
```

```bash
curl -sS https://downloads.1password.com/linux/keys/1password.asc | \
 sudo gpg --dearmor --output /usr/share/debsig/keyrings/AC2D62742012EA22/debsig.gpg
```

Install 1Password CLI:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install 1password-cli
```

Check that 1Password CLI installed successfully:
```bash
op --version
```

## Configure 1Password with a Service Account ##
**Create a service account**
*Source: https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/get-started/*

1. Sign in to your account on 1Password.com.
2. Click Integrations in the sidebar. If you already have active integrations, click Directory at the top of the Integrations page.
3. Under Infrastructure Secrets Management, click Other.
4. Click Create a Service Account and follow the onscreen instructions:
   * Choose a name for the service account.
   * Select whether or not the service account can create vaults.
   * Select the vaults the service account can access, then click the settings icon  to select the permissions it has in each vault.
   * Click Save in 1Password to save the service account token in your 1Password account. In the next window, enter a name for the item and choose a vault to save it in.

Note that after creating a service account, you can't edit its ability to create vaults or the permissions it has for vaults it can access.

{{< notice "warning" >}}
**The Service Account Creation Wizard only shows the service account token once. Save the token in 1Password immediately to avoid losing it. Treat this token like a password, and don't store it in plaintext.
{{< /notice >}}


**Set ENV Variable with Token**
Enter the following at the command line:
```bash
export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<your-service-account-token>
```

Test that it worked.
```bash
op user get --me
```

## The Automation ##
Generally, the next part will do the following:
1) Create a 1Password Vault and share it with the user.
2) Create a 1Password item for the PGP Passphrase.
3) Create new PGP Master Key
4) Create new PGP Sub-Keys for encryption and signing
5) Export the public key and upload it to the user's vault and a company-wide key ring.
6) Export the private key and upload it to the user's vault.

## Creating the script ##
Enter your favorite text editor.
```bash
nano issueKey.sh
```
Copy/paste the below BASH script.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script will create the needed 1Password Vaults, issue PGP certs/sub-keys, and upload
# to the correct 1Password Vaults.
