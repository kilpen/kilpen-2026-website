## Business Challenge

A startup company needed to manage a complex vendor ecosystem. The organization employed independent contractors on short-term projects, requiring tracking of hundreds of projects with thousands of contractors along with multiple Statements of Work and invoices per contractor. Commercial solutions exceeded their budget constraints.

## Objective

Develop a project and vendor management system using Google Workspace aligned with the Project Management Institute's Body of Knowledge framework, covering:

- Cost management
- Schedule management
- Quality management
- Risk management
- Procurement management
- Resource management

## Implementation

The team constructed a comprehensive solution leveraging Google Sites, Sheets, Forms, Docs, and APIs. The system included:

- Process diagrams mapped to business activities
- Multiple dashboards for project visibility
- Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)
- Risk and stakeholder registers
- Deliverables tracking
- Centralized Master File for financial data and accounts payable forecasting

## Timeline

**Development:** Iterative implementation across three years
