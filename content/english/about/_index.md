Founded in 2016, KilPen Technical Services is a Hawaii-based, family-owned company specializing in bespoke technology solutions for nonprofit organizations and businesses driven by social mission. We understand that organizations working to make the world better deserve technology partners who share their values—and who can deliver tailored solutions that respect both their unique needs and their limited resources.

## Our Focus

We work primarily with nonprofits, social enterprises, and mission-driven organizations. These clients face distinct challenges: tight budgets, complex stakeholder relationships, and the need to maximize every dollar toward their cause. Our services are designed specifically for this landscape, providing enterprise-quality solutions at nonprofit-friendly terms.

## Bespoke Solutions, Complete Confidentiality

Every engagement begins with understanding your specific situation. We don't believe in one-size-fits-all approaches—your organization's technology needs are as unique as your mission. Our bespoke service model means we craft solutions tailored precisely to your requirements, timeline, and budget.

We also understand that nonprofits and social enterprises often handle sensitive information—donor data, client records, strategic plans, and financial details. **Confidentiality is foundational to how we operate.** Your information stays protected, and we maintain strict discretion about our client relationships unless you choose otherwise.

## Our Values

As a veteran-founded business, our values are rooted in service, community, and inclusivity. We proudly support diversity, with a particular focus on uplifting the LGBTQ+ community and creating an equitable environment for all. Our team is driven by a passion for leveraging technology to help mission-driven organizations succeed.
